# Interface
The `interface` library provides functions to update the registry of installed packages via the `regman` interface. It consists of five functions:
- fpkg
- fver
- print
- rmpkg
- write
The `regman` program is called thanks to the `unirun` library, which provides functions to execute a program by saving its output in a buffer.
